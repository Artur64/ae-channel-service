# ae-channel-service

The [channel_runner](apps/ae_socket_connector/lib/channel_runner.ex) is to be considered as a `state-channel` client, which will execute several state channel operations, as token transfers and off-chain contract calls.

This implementation benefits by being able calling erlang functions provided by the core team.

make shell
```
requires OTP 20.3

```
iex(1)> ChannelRunner.start_channel_helper()
